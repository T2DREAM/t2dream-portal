This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of this, if available, otherwise the object's [[Class]] internal property.\n- `getFunctionName`: returns the name of the current function, typically its name property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.\n- `getMethodName`: returns the name of the property of this or one of its prototypes that holds the current function\n- `getFileName`: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script\n- `getLineNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number\n- `getColumnNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number\n- `getEvalOrigin`: if this function was created using a call to eval returns a CallSite object representing the location where eval was called\n- `isToplevel`: is this a top-level invocation, that is, is this the global object?\n- `isEval`: does this call take place in code defined by a call to eval?\n- `isNative`: is this call in native V8 code?\n- `isConstructor`: is this a constructor call?\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n","readmeFilename":"readme.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/callsites/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/callsites#readme","_id":"callsites@2.0.0","_shasum":"06eb84f00eea413da86affefacbffb36093b3c50","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/callsites/-/callsites-2.0.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/callsites/-/callsites-2.0.0.tgz"}
