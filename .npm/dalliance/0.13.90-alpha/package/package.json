It works with current versions of Chrome, Firefox, and\nSafari and (with minor visual glitches) Internet Explorer 11.  It\nis also usable with current mobile web browsers.\n\nTo try it, visit [https://www.biodalliance.org/human37.html](https://www.biodalliance.org/human37.html).\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nDalliance has now switched to a [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)-based build\nsystem.  It it still possible to use the files in the js directory\ndirectly, but this is now deprecated and may not be supported in future.\n\nBefore building, please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), which\nis needed for the NPM package manager.\n\nTo build:\n\n        (sudo?) npm install -g gulp\n        npm install # Install dependencies\n        gulp        # Build Dalliance\n\n...then open any of the HTML files in the `example-browsers` directory\nto test.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nSee [the website](https://www.biodalliance.org).\n\nReporting bugs\n--------------\n\nDalliance is under active development and we welcome your suggestions.\nRight now, probably the best place for bug reports or feature requests\nis the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/dasmoth/dalliance/issues).\n\nThere is also a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biodalliance-dev)\nwhere the project can be discussed.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dasmoth/dalliance/issues"},"_id":"dalliance@0.13.90-alpha","_shasum":"32dc6b3b7e152bc31ff4a6347da1811cdb610882","_from":"git://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/dalliance.git#f8cb3e60af399560041021ac527e33eef935814b","_resolved":"git://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/dalliance.git#f8cb3e60af399560041021ac527e33eef935814b"}
