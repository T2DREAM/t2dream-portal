This provides extensions functionally identical to the default ones, which you know you can access reliably, no matter what extensions have been installed previously.\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save default-require-extensions\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst js = require('default-require-extensions/js');\nconst json = require('default-require-extensions/json');\n\nrequire.extensions['.js'] = js;\nrequire.extensions['.js'] = json;\n\n```\n\n*Note: * You would never actually do the above. Use these in your custom require extensions instead.  \n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© Node.js contributors, [James Talmage](http://github.com/jamestalmage)\n","readmeFilename":"readme.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/default-require-extensions/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/default-require-extensions#readme","_id":"default-require-extensions@1.0.0","_shasum":"f37ea15d3e13ffd9b437d33e1a75b5fb97874cb8","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/default-require-extensions/-/default-require-extensions-1.0.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/default-require-extensions/-/default-require-extensions-1.0.0.tgz"}
