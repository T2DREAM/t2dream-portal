It uses\ntyped arrays instead of binary strings for storing data.  Simplistic testing suggests\nthat this can give about a 2-fold speedup, and also means that JSZlib is a good\nmatch for tools which use ArrayBuffers and/or typed arrays to access binary data.\n\nJSZlib currently just implements the \"inflate\" part of zlib, but there will hopefully\nbe a port of the \"deflate\" portion in the future.\n\nJSZlib is based very closely on jzlib (http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/), and is distributed\nunder the same (BSD-style) license.  The author of jzlib, ymnk, in turn credits Jean-loup\nGailly and Mark Adler for the original zlib code.\n\nUsing it\n--------\n\nSimplest way is just to call jszlib_uncompress.  Takes an ArrayBuffer, returns an ArrayBuffer,\nthrows an exception if something breaks.  You can also use a ZStream class which behaves\nmuch like ZStream from jzlib.  This might be useful if you need to uncompress partial data --\nsome kinds of streaming network protocol, for instance -- but is overkill for most applications.","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"jszlib@0.2.1","_shasum":"a037bd96ecc06da013f99158e875f75854d3dc4a","_from":"dasmoth/jszlib#4e562c7b88749f3e1e402737ddef5f96bf0906c6","_resolved":"git://github.com/dasmoth/jszlib.git#4e562c7b88749f3e1e402737ddef5f96bf0906c6"}
