Just open the file and handle the error when it's not there.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save path-exists\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\n// foo.js\nconst pathExists = require('path-exists');\n\npathExists('foo.js').then(exists => {\n\tconsole.log(exists);\n\t//=> true\n});\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### pathExists(path)\n\nReturns a promise for a boolean of whether the path exists.\n\n### pathExists.sync(path)\n\nReturns a boolean of whether the path exists.\n\n\n## Related\n\n- [path-exists-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/path-exists-cli) - CLI for this module\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n","readmeFilename":"readme.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/path-exists/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/path-exists#readme","_id":"path-exists@3.0.0","_shasum":"ce0ebeaa5f78cb18925ea7d810d7b59b010fd515","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/path-exists/-/path-exists-3.0.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/path-exists/-/path-exists-3.0.0.tgz"}
