This makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the \"DOM tree\" rendered by a React DOM or React Native component without using a browser or jsdom.\n\n```jsx\nconst ReactTestRenderer = require('react-test-renderer');\n\nconst renderer = ReactTestRenderer.create(\n  <Link page=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</Link>\n);\n\nconsole.log(renderer.toJSON());\n// { type: 'a',\n//   props: { href: 'https://www.facebook.com/' },\n//   children: [ 'Facebook' ] }\n```\n\nYou can also use Jest's snapshot testing feature to automatically save a copy of the JSON tree to a file and check in your tests that it hasn't changed: http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html.\n\n#### Shallow renderer\n\nShallow rendering lets you render a component \"one level deep\" and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered. This does not require a DOM.\n\n```jsx\nconst ReactShallowRenderer = require('react-test-renderer/shallow');\n\nconst renderer = new ReactShallowRenderer();\nrenderer.render(<MyComponent />);\n\nconst result = renderer.getRenderOutput();\nexpect(result.type).toBe('div');\nexpect(result.props.children).toEqual([\n  <span className=\"heading\">Title</span>,\n  <Subcomponent foo=\"bar\" />\n]);\n```\n\nThis renderer was previously located in `react-addons-test-utils`.","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"react-test-renderer@15.6.1","_shasum":"026f4a5bb5552661fd2cc4bbcd0d4bc8a35ebf7e","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/react-test-renderer/-/react-test-renderer-15.6.1.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/react-test-renderer/-/react-test-renderer-15.6.1.tgz"}
