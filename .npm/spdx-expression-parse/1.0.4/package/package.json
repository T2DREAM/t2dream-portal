The npm command-line interface depends on this package, as do many automatic license-audit tools.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\n```javascript\nvar parse = require('spdx-expression-parse')\nvar assert = require('assert')\n\nassert.deepEqual(\n  // Licensed under the terms of the Two-Clause BSD License.\n  parse('BSD-2-Clause'),\n  {license: 'BSD-2-Clause'}\n)\n\nassert.throws(function () {\n  // An invalid SPDX license expression.\n  // Should be `Apache-2.0`.\n  parse('Apache 2')\n})\n\nassert.deepEqual(\n  // Dual licensed under LGPL 2.1 or a combination of the Three-Clause\n  // BSD License and the MIT License.\n  parse('(LGPL-2.1 OR BSD-3-Clause AND MIT)'),\n  {\n    left: {license: 'LGPL-2.1'},\n    conjunction: 'or',\n    right: {\n      left: {license: 'BSD-3-Clause'},\n      conjunction: 'and',\n      right: {license: 'MIT'}\n    }\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThe syntax comes from the [Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX)](https://spdx.org/), a standard from the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org) for shareable data about software package license terms.  SPDX aims to make sharing and auditing license data easy, especially for users of open-source software.\n\nThe bulk of the SPDX standard describes syntax and semantics of XML metadata files.  This package implements two lightweight, plain-text components of that larger standard:\n\n1.  The [license list](https://spdx.org/licenses), a mapping from specific string identifiers, like `Apache-2.0`, to standard form license texts and bolt-on license exceptions.  The [spdx-license-ids](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spdx-exceptions) and [spdx-exceptions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spdx-license-ids) packages implement the license list.  They are development dependencies of this package.\n\n    Any license identifier from the license list is a valid license expression:\n\n    ```javascript\n    require('spdx-license-ids').forEach(function (id) {\n      assert.deepEqual(parse(id), {license: id})\n    })\n    ```\n\n    So is any license identifier `WITH` a standardized license exception:\n\n    ```javascript\n    require('spdx-license-ids').forEach(function (id) {\n      require('spdx-exceptions').forEach(function (e) {\n        assert.deepEqual(\n          parse(id + ' WITH ' + e),\n          {license: id, exception: e}\n        )\n      })\n    })\n    ```\n\n2.  The license expression language, for describing simple and complex license terms, like `MIT` for MIT-licensed and `(GPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0)` for dual-licensing under GPL 2.0 and Apache 2.0.  This package implements the license expression language.\n\n    ```javascript\n    assert.deepEqual(\n      // Licensed under a combination of the MIT License and a combination\n      // of LGPL 2.1 (or a later version) and the Three-Clause BSD License.\n      parse('(MIT AND (LGPL-2.1+ AND BSD-3-Clause))'),\n      {\n        left: {license: 'MIT'},\n        conjunction: 'and',\n        right: {\n          left: {license: 'LGPL-2.1', plus: true},\n          conjunction: 'and',\n          right: {license: 'BSD-3-Clause'}\n        }\n      }\n    )\n    ```\n\nThe Linux Foundation and its contributors license the SPDX standard under the terms of [the Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported (SPDX: \"CC-BY-3.0\")](http://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-3.0).  \"SPDX\" is a United States federally registered trademark of the Linux Foundation.
